This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in Java: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The `UncommonErrorExample.java` file contains the buggy code that attempts to access an array element outside its valid range. The `UncommonErrorSolution.java` file provides a corrected version that prevents this exception. This example highlights the importance of carefully checking array boundaries to prevent unexpected runtime errors.
